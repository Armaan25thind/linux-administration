## Experiment :- 13-14.

## Purpose :- Implement chown, chmod command with their options

## Syntax :- 
chown Command (Change File Owner and Group)
``chown [OPTIONS] [OWNER][:GROUP] FILE``

```
Change the owner of a file to 'user1'
sudo chown user1 file.txt

Change owner and group of a file
sudo chown user1:group1 file.txt

Change ownership of all files inside a directory recursively
sudo chown -R user1:group1 /path/to/directory
```

## A) Implement chown, chmod command with their options.

### Step 1 - Open Linux and create a new file using the touch command.

```
touch example_file.txt
```

- To change both owner and group, use:

```
chown username:groupname example_file.txt
```

### Step 3 - Verify ownership change using ls -l.

```
ls -l example_file.txt
```
- The output will show the updated owner and group of the file.

## B) Problem: Change file permissions using chmod.

### Step 1 - Create a file or directory.

```
touch another_file.txt
```

### Step 2 - Modify permissions using octal values.

```
chmod 755 another_file.txt
```
- This sets the permissions as follows:
-- Owner: Read, write, execute.
-- Group: Read, execute.
-- Others: Read, execute.

### Step 3 - Verify the changes.

```
ls -l another_file.txt
```

- The output will display the file permissions as -rwxr-xr-x.
